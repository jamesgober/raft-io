//! # raft-io
//!
//! A from-scratch implementation of the [Raft consensus algorithm], built as a
//! clean, embeddable library rather than a framework.
//!
//! The protocol core is a **deterministic state machine**: you feed it
//! [`Event`]s (logical ticks, inbound [`Message`]s, client proposals) and it
//! returns [`Action`]s (send these messages, apply this committed command).
//! Time, networking, and storage are *your* concern, injected through the
//! [`RaftLog`] and [`RaftTransport`] trait seams. That separation is exactly
//! what makes the consensus core provable: it contains no wall clock and no
//! I/O, so an entire cluster's behaviour can be reproduced from a seed and a
//! sequence of events.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! This is `v0.6`: **feature complete.** Election, the full replication pipeline,
//! durable persistence with crash recovery (`persistence` feature), snapshots
//! with log compaction, `pack-io` wire framing (`framing` feature), and now
//! **membership changes** — add or remove a voter one server at a time, and
//! transfer leadership — round out the protocol. Hardening and the API/protocol
//! freeze follow in `v0.7`. See `docs/API.md` for the full surface.
//!
//! ## The three tiers
//!
//! - **Tier 1** — the common case in a handful of calls, no builder and no
//!   generic to name: [`RaftNode::new`] with a [`RaftConfig`] and the default
//!   in-memory [`MemoryLog`].
//! - **Tier 2** — [`RaftConfig`]'s builder for tuning election and heartbeat
//!   timing.
//! - **Tier 3** — the [`RaftLog`] / [`RaftTransport`] traits for plugging in a
//!   durable store or a real transport.
//!
//! ## Example — a single-node cluster elects itself and commits
//!
//! ```
//! use raft_io::{Action, Event, RaftConfig, RaftNode};
//!
//! // One node, no peers: it reaches quorum (itself) the moment it times out.
//! let mut node = RaftNode::new(RaftConfig::single(1));
//!
//! // Drive logical ticks until the node becomes leader.
//! while !node.is_leader() {
//!     let _ = node.step(Event::Tick).expect("tick never fails in memory");
//! }
//! assert_eq!(node.leader(), Some(1));
//!
//! // A leader commits its own proposals immediately (quorum of one).
//! let actions = node.step(Event::Propose(b"set x = 1".to_vec())).unwrap();
//! assert!(actions.iter().any(|a| matches!(a, Action::Apply { .. })));
//! assert_eq!(node.commit_index(), 1);
//! ```
